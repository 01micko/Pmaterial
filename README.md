# PMaterial
loose material design icon theme

##Preview

[<img src="PMaterial.png" style="width:100%">](PMaterial.png)


## Build

First type `export THEME="PMaterial"`.

Then type `make`.

The icons will be built in `"PMaterial"` directory.

To install just type `make install`. `DESTDIR` is supported.

Alternatively, just run the `build_theme` script from the current location
if you don't have `make`. The Makefile is just a convenience for packaging;
entirely not necessary.

## Artwork

I am no artist! ( @01micko ). Some of the icons could do with some (a lot?)
of work. Feel free to send in your pull requests but no icons built from InkScape 
or other SVG editors please.

## Thanks

Many thanks to @technosaurus and @zigbert for enlightening me on SVG!
